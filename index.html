    <p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San%C4%81tana_Dharma">Sanātana Dharma</a></b> <i>(Devanagari: सनातन
            धर्म, meaning "eternal dharma",</i> "eternal order")[1] is an endonym used by <u>Hindus to refer to
            Hinduism</u>. It refers to the “eternal” truth and teachings of Hinduism. It can also be translated as “the
        natural and eternal way to live".
        <hr>
        [2]The term is used in Indian languages alongside the more common Hindu Dharma for Hinduism.
        <br>
        [3] Sanatana Dharma can also denote the list of 'eternal' or absolute duties and practices
    </p>
    <h3>Importance of Sanātana Dharma</h3>
    <div>In Sanskrit, Sanātana Dharma translates approximately to "eternal law" or, less literally, "eternal way."[5] In
        Pali, the equivalent term is Dhammo Sanātano (धम्मो सनन्तनो).[5] In Hindi, the Sanskrit tatsama dharm धर्म is
        being used as "religion"[6] (सनातन धर्म) roughly translates to "eternal religion".</div>

        There are certain beliefs which are basic to Sanatana Dharma. The belief that the atma is superior to the body,
        the conviction that the atma must strive for moksha, the belief in repeated births until the atma is finally
        liberated, the belief that God alone can liberate us, the belief that the liberated soul is never reborn.
    </div>
    <div>
        All jivatmas are born due to their karma, and what they face in life is a result of their karma. Every atma must
        resort to a way to reach God. God Himself has given us many choices in this respect. We can resort to karma
        yoga, bhakti yoga or gnana yoga, or Saranagati, to reach Him. And this should be our aim in life. Moksha is the
        goal we should work towards.
